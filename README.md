Project Description:

This project will train you how to use SQL to analyze a real-world database, how to extract the most useful information from the dataset, how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance, how to use a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database, and how to visualize the data using the Tableau/PowerBI tool.

This is the real world data analysis project conducted by HiCounselor as a 2 week challenge.

The real dataset, client requirements, the tools which will be used, everything related to the project had been given in a sandbox link in their website.

It Contains 3 modules:

Module 1:

Let's start with module 1 by downloading superstore_final_dataset.csv in the given sandbox link (HiCounselor platform).

To Complete the task, pre-processed the data using python and then uploaded the cleaned superstore analysis csv data file in phpMyAdmin. Converted the csv file to sql file. Used the database credentials in sandbox platform to read the sql file and work on sql queries.

Now the data is imported successfully and ready to use for analysis.

Once the data is ready, to get the information from the data wriiten sql queries.

Later visualisations are made, to draw the relations between the data.
